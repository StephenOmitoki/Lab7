Overview:

This program performs text analysis on a file named data.txt. It reads the content of the file, processes the text to collect various statistics, and displays the results. The program provides insights such as the number of letters, words, lines, word frequencies, letter frequencies, and even histograms to visualize the data.

Compile and Run:

Use any C++ compiler or IDE.

View Results:

After running the program, it will process the text in data.txt and display:
Letter, word, and line counts

A dictionary of unique words
Word frequencies and histograms
